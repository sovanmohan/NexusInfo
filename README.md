# Project Title: Stock Market Prediction 
# Description:
This project explores the use of a Random Forest classifier to predict stock market price movements. The model leverages historical market data to identify patterns and trends, aiming to provide insights into potential future price directions.

# Data Preprocessing:
1) Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
2) Address outliers (e.g., clipping, winsorization).
3) Scale numerical features for consistent model training.

# Model Training:
1) Split the data into training and testing sets.
2) Train a Random Forest classifier, tuning hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, maximum depth) through cross-validation to optimize performance.

# Prediction:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points (unseen future prices).

# Dependencies:

Python libraries commonly used for data science and machine learning (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn).
Specific libraries for financial data analysis might be required depending on your chosen data source and feature engineering techniques.

# Configure Data Source:
Modify the script to connect to your chosen data source and retrieve historical stock data.
Ensure the script handles data formatting and feature extraction according to the specific data structure.

# Run the Script:
Execute the main script (e.g., main.py) to perform data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and potentially save the trained model for future use.
